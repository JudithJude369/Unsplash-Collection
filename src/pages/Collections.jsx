        ⭐ 1. TypeScript is NOT required for your first job TypeScript is nice
        to have, but it is not required for junior roles. Most companies hiring
        juniors expect: Strong JavaScript fundamentals Basic to intermediate
        React Ability to fetch APIs Ability to build UI components Ability to
        style pages Ability to manage state (Zustand/context) And that’s it.
        Many junior developers get hired first, then learn TypeScript on the
        job. ⭐ 2. Next.js is also NOT required for your first job Here’s the
        truth: Some companies use Next.js Some use plain React Some use Vue Some
        use Angular Some use Astro, Remix, Svelte, etc. React alone already gets
        you into many jobs. Learning Next.js later will make you even more
        employable, but it is NOT mandatory for your first job. ⭐ 3. What
        matters MOST for hiring juniors These 5 things matter more than
        TypeScript or Next.js: ✔ A solid portfolio ✔ Clean, readable code ✔
        Ability to build real projects ✔ Understanding of APIs ✔ A good
        fullstack project (like the one you plan to build) If you build: A
        strong frontend project A fullstack capstone project A portfolio site
        You will look ready for junior roles. ⭐ 4. Companies don’t expect
        juniors to know everything Juniors are hired for potential, not
        perfection. Companies expect to teach you: TypeScript Next.js Testing
        Backend basics CI/CD Advanced tools No junior knows all that. You
        already have the core skills.
